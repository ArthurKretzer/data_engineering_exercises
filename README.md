# Data engineering exercises

**Python** is mandatory for running these exercises.

Each exercise has a "requirements.txt" file that should be installed in order to execute the scripts.

```pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Jupyter notebook is recommended for better data visualization.

To install **venv** to jupyter you must run the following command on **virtualenv**

```python
python -m ipykernel install --user --name=myenv
```
